<h1>IU</h1>
<h3>Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993), also known by her stage name IU (Korean: 아이유)</h3>
<h3>A South Korean singer-songwriter, record producer and actress.</h3>
<h2>Career</h2>
<h4>She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her first extended play (EP) Lost and Found (2008). Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was only after the release of "Good Day" (Korean: 좋은 날), the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on Billboard's "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list.</h4>
<h2>Awards and Achievements</h2>
<h4>Since her debut in 2008, IU has received over 200 award nominations, winning over 100 of them. She has won twenty-one Melon Music Awards, sixteen Gaon Chart Music Awards, five Korean Music Awards, eleven Mnet Asian Music Awards, seven Seoul Music Awards, and eight Golden Disc Awards. IU has also won several awards for her work as an actress, earning the title "Best New Actress" at the 2014 KBS Drama Awards for her performance in You're the Best, Lee Soon-shin.</h4>
<h4>IU has received ten Daesang (grand prize) awards from various award shows, including five from the Melon Music Awards and three from the Golden Disc Awards. In 2012, she was named to the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list as one of the most influential people in South Korea, and has since been mentioned five times. Additionally, IU was honored at the 2015 Korean Popular Culture and Arts Awards, held by the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, for her influence and success in the music industry. In 2022, she was recipient of the Visionary Award, instituted by CJ ENM, which recognizes talents from the Korean film and television industry for their contributions to "leading trends and spearheading innovations."</h4>
